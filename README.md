# LICENSE
Which licenses am I using?

There are various licenses I use for my projects.

## Licenses for source code

### AGPL

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License) ︱ [Official website](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

I'm advocating for FLOSS: free/libre open-source software, and I'm trying my best to contribute to it. AGPL helps to achieve it further: it forbids modifying software for proprietary use without opening the modified source code and applying the same AGPL license.

While it may be too restrictive, to balance things, I only apply this license to the projects I value the most.

### LGPL

LGPL is less restrictive, but it shares some features with AGPL. It allows all private modifications, however if you voluntarily decide to publish modified code or software built with it, you must use GPL-compatible license (LGPL counts).

I use this license for less important projects, but which I can't share without expecting credit for them.

### Apache License

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) ︱ [Official website](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

The most permissive license. Almost do whatever you want. With some limitations, of course, but in the vast majority of cases it doesn't matter.

I use this license if I don't care what happens to the project. It can take on a life of its own, I won't have strong feelings.

## Licenses for audiovisual content

I use Creative Commons. Most common variant is CC BY 4.0.

- In case of music, it shouldn't rely too much on recognizable leitmotifs. Remixes of popular media are not allowed for CC licensing.
- In case of videos, they should have elements created from scratch, without using existing footages and graphical content.
- In case of images, they should be created from scratch, meaning that you need to have a project file containing every separate detail of the result image (however you don't have to publish it). Recreations of the popular design elements (like DDLC New Heading logo) are not allowed for CC licensing.

Otherwise, the content is unlicensed. Does it mean that you can do whatever you want in this case? No. More like it doesn't guarantee you anything.
